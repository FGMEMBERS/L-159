CURRENT VERSION:  0.7


CHANGELOG:


0.1 - 30.3.2014
Initial non-release version, FDM written from scratch
No animations, no textures, just static model (provided by pjedvaj) and FDM


0.2 - 02.04.2014
Second non-release version
FDM: 
-Added properly placed speedbrake
-More speed bleed at turns, a bit more throttle on landing needed
3D model: 
-Fixed ambient light
-Fixed tail color
-Fixed pilot seat position
Animations, effects: 
-Landing gear and airbrake animated
-Added tip trails, smoke (with custom modified texture), contrail (depends on property /environment/contrail)
Other: 
-Cockpit view position adjusted


0.3 - 13.4.2014
Another non-release development version
FDM: 
-Major FDM overhaul, now properly scaled (before, the overall size was based on wrong information => ~97% of true size)
-Changed coordinate system
-Landing speed, climb rate, takeoff roll etc. now better match real performance
-Revisited and corrected fuel tanks position and capacity
3D model: 
-Changed coordinate system (no longer [0,0,0] at nosetip) to counter multiplayer center of view issues
-Fixed minor Y offset
-Fixed gear door and speedbrake color
Sound: 
-Added basic sound effects with some customizations; will be subject to further tuning
Animations, effects: 
-Nose gear shaft door animation asymmetry fixed
Other:
-Custom autopilot tuned


0.4 - 26.04.2014
3D model: 
-Brand new model by pjedvaj
-Added some details (bottom beacon, taxi light, landing lights reflectors)
-Some materials customizations
Animations, effects:
-All standard animations implemented
-Added wing vapour (scales depending on alpha)
-Tuned smoke dynamics, added heat haze
-Nav lights, landing lights, taxi light and beacon animated (with blend in daylight), works over MP, lights control dialog added
Sound: 
-MP sound support, fixed constant stall warning over MP


0.5 - 04.05.2014
Animations, effects: 
-Rembrandt support
-Fixed nav light animation problems when disabling and reenabling quickly
-Landing lights point more down, tuned dist-scale
-Nav lights and beacon flares centered accurately
3D model: 
-Detriangulized mesh, many manual cleanups where automated tool made mistakes
-Removed some doubled vertices (discovered when handling detriangulization mistakes), slight alignment of some parts
Other:
-Slight redesign of lights dialog


0.6 - 25.05.2014
Animations, effects:
-Fixed multiple nav lights and beacon timers running at once when MP aircraft reconnects
-Payloads support (MP transfered visibility)
-Bullet impact animation, MP visible tracers
-Rembrandt light on fuel probe
3D model: 
-PL-20 Plamen cannon pod modelled
-Optional experimental fuel probe
-Some material changes
-Weak Chrome effect on canopy
-Taller wing pylons
-Work on details of the model (nosetip fix, beacon shape, ...)
Sound: 
-Fixed missing parts of MP sound
-Cannon sound (using stock sound for now)
Other:
-Help dialog added


0.7 - 9.7.2014
Animations, effects:
-Unique  disintegration animation on impact
-Impact explosion animation with fire and smoke
-Slightly increased range of MP bullets animation
-Everything so far mentioned works over MP
-Flares tuned
-Rembrandt landing lights direction tuned
FDM: 
-Elevator response fixed
-Reduced aileron effectiveness
-Fixed wrong fuel solver settings from last version
-More dragging flaps (watch your speed on landing!)
-It's much more difficult to fly with heavy payload
Sound:
-Stall warning tuned to match current stall behavior
Systems:
-Internal fuel transfer system
-Automatic flap retracting
-Automatic speedbrake deployment when exceeding Vne
Other:
-Fixed roll axis autopilot behavior
-Aircraft help dialog updated
