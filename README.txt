Aero L-159 ALCA (Advanced Light Combat Aircraft) is a multirole light combat aircraft and an advanced jet trainer designed and made in the Czech Republic. The design is based on the L-39 Albatros and L-59 Super Albatros, one of the most widely used trainer aircraft ever.

Compared to its predecessors, it has much more powerful engine, uses modern materials (thus being more sturdy and enabling higher weapon load) and has modern radar and avionics. The trainer version is suitable for advanced jet training before stepping to modern supersonic fighter jets. L-159 can carry wide variety of standard NATO weapons on its 7 external pylons as well as up to three specially designed PL-20 Plamen (Flame) cannon pods. It's a subsonic aircraft and offers a great maneuverability. It can be operated from unpaved surface thanks to its special low-pressure tyres and engine inlets located above the wing.

L-159 Is currently used by the Czech Air Force and is operated from Caslav airport (LKCV).

The version modeled here is L-159B, two seated variant suitable for both training and combat use.
